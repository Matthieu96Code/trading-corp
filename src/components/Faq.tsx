                    <p>
                        Based on our experience with the systems/robots, it is recommended to trade on a 1-hour time frame (H1). However, you can test them on longer time frames, such as 4 hours (H4), 1 day (D1), 1 week (W1), 1 month (MN).

                    <p>
                        Given the dynamic and flexible nature of the financial market, it&apos;s challenging to predict in advance the ratio between gain and invested capital. However, the systems/robots can end the week or month in profit as long as you adhere to the system&apos;s recommendations (entry conditions, application of stop-loss).
